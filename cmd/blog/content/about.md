Hi there! I’m a dedicated web developer with a passion for creating innovative and robust solutions. My journey in tech spans various languages and frameworks, including Go, JavaScript, TypeScript, Rust, C, and C++. I love working with tools like React.js and HTMX to build interactive and user-friendly web applications.

My backend expertise covers databases such as MongoDB, MySQL, and PostgreSQL, and I use Redis to optimize caching for better performance. I’m also skilled in HTML and CSS, ensuring that my projects not only function well but look great too.

In addition to my development skills, I have a strong background in security and AI. This knowledge helps me build secure applications and explore advanced technologies to solve complex problems. I’m always excited to learn and grow, and I enjoy tackling new challenges in the ever-evolving tech landscape.
